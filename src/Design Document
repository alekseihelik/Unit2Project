LinearEquation class
Instance Variables:
private int xOne - This variable represents the first x-coordinate
private int yOne - this variable represents the first y-coordinate
private int xTwo - this variable represents the second x-coordinate
private int yTwo - this variable represents the second y-coordinate
private String firstPairLocation - represents the first inputted pair
private String secondPairLocation - represents the second inputted pair
private String slopeIs - set to the slope of the two pairs
private String yInterceptIs - set to the y-intercept
private String slopeIntercept - set to the slope intercept form
private String distance - set to the distance between points

Constructor
public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
The constructor will use the parameters it is given to calculate all necessary information about the instance and set the information to variables

Methods

public String coordinateSolver(double thirdX)
This method will be used to solve the coordinate point using the third x value that will be inputted

public String toString()
This method will display all relevant information about this instance including:
- X and Y coordinate information
- Slope Intercept Form equation
- Slope of the line
- Y-intercept
- Distance between points

EquationRunner.java
Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
Step 3: Parse out the given coordinate points
Step 4: Use the LinearEquation constructor
Step 5: Use the toString() method
Step 6: Ask the user for an x-value
Step 7: Print out the solved coordinate value of the x-value by adding the y-value based on the slope intercept form
