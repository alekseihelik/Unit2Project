LinearEquation class
Instance Variables:
private int x1 - This variable represents the first x-coordinate
private int y1 - this variable represents the first y-coordinate
private int x2 - this variable represents the second x-coordinate
private int y2 - this variable represents the second y-coordinate

Constructor
public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
The constructor will use the parameters it is given to calculate all necessary information about the instance and set the information to variables

Methods

public String toString()
This method will display all relevant information about this instance including:
- X and Y coordinate information
- Slope Intercept Form equation
- Slope of the line
- Y-intercept
- Distance between points

EquationRunner.java
Step 1: Ask user to enter first coordinate point
Step 2: Ask user to enter second coordinate point
Step 3: Parse out the given coordinate points
Step 4: Use the LinearEquation constructor
Step 5: Use the toString() method
Step 6: Ask the user for an x-value
Step 7: Print out the solved coordinate value of the x-value by adding the y-value based on the slope
